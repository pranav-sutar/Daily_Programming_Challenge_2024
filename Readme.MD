Day 1 of 30 🗓️

Problem: Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s
You are given an array arr consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array in increasing order in linear time (i.e., O(n)) without using any extra space. This means you need to rearrange the array in-place.

Input :
An integer array arr of size n where each element is either 0, 1, or 2.
Example : arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Output :
The sorted array, arranged in increasing order of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
Example: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Day 2 of 30 🗓️

Problem: Find the missing number
You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.

Input :
An integer array arr of size n-1 where the elements are distinct and taken from the range 1 to n.
Example : arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]

Output :
Return the missing integer from the array.
Example: Missing Number : 3

Day 3 of 30 🗓️

Problem: Find the duplicate number
You are given an array arr containing n+1 integers, where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is exactly one duplicate number in the array, but it may appear more than once. Your task is to find the duplicate number without modifying the array and using constant extra space.
Input :
An integer array arr of size n+1, where each element is an integer in the range [1, n].
Example : arr = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]

Output :
Return the duplicate integer present in the array.
Example: Duplicate Number : 3

Day 4 of 30 🗓️

Problem : Merge Two Sorted Arrays
You are given two sorted arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n. Your task is to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array without using any extra space (i.e., in-place merging). The elements in arr1 should be merged first, followed by the elements of arr2, resulting in both arrays being sorted after the merge.

Input :
Two sorted integer arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n.
Example : 
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]

Output :
Both arr1 and arr2 should be sorted after the merge. Since you cannot use extra space, the final result will be reflected in arr1 and arr2.
Example:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
